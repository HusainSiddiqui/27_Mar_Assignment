While this can be advantageous for feature selection, it can also lead to the omission of important features that may have nonlinear or interactive effects.\n",

However, if interpretability is not a primary concern, more complex models like decision trees or ensemble methods may offer better predictive performance.\n",

Optimal Hyperparameter Selection: Regularized linear models require tuning hyperparameters, such as the regularization parameter (e.g., alpha), to achieve the desired balance between bias and variance.
